            <p> Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing
                prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to
                reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and
                hormones.</p>
